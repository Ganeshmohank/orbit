## Features Implemented

### 1. Voice-Activated Booking ‚úÖ
- [x] Detects trigger phrases: "book an uber to [destination]", etc.
- [x] Uses OpenAI GPT-3.5 to extract destination from voice
- [x] Collects up to 5 voice segments or stops on 5+ second gap
- [x] Silent during collection, notifies only on completion
- [x] Handles variations: "SFO", "San Francisco Airport", "the airport"
- [x] Cleans up filler words: "um", "uh", etc.

### 2. One-Time Authentication with 2FA ‚úÖ
- [x] User authenticates Uber account ONCE in the Omi app
- [x] Uses Playwright to capture browser session during login
- [x] **HANDLES 2FA/MFA**:
  - [x] Detects if Uber prompts for 2FA (SMS code, authenticator app, etc.)
  - [x] Pauses automation and shows input field for user to enter 2FA code
  - [x] Waits up to 5 minutes for user to complete 2FA
  - [x] Continues after successful 2FA verification
  - [x] Saves complete authenticated session
- [x] Saves session permanently (storage_state with cookies/localStorage)
- [x] Never asks for login again - reuses saved session for all future bookings
- [x] Handles "Remember this device" checkbox to minimize future 2FA prompts

### 3. 2FA Code Input Handling ‚úÖ
- [x] Created endpoint: POST /submit-2fa-code
  - [x] Accepts: {"uid": "user123", "code": "123456"}
  - [x] Injects code into waiting Playwright browser instance
  - [x] Continues authentication flow
- [x] Shows real-time status during auth:
  - [x] "Waiting for login..."
  - [x] "2FA detected - please enter code below"
  - [x] "Verifying code..."
  - [x] "‚úÖ Authentication successful!"
- [x] Stores session only after full authentication (including 2FA)

### 4. Session Validation & Re-Authentication ‚úÖ
- [x] Before each booking, validates session is still active
- [x] If session expired or 2FA required again:
  - [x] Sends notification: "Please re-authenticate your Uber account"
  - [x] Redirects to /auth for fresh login
  - [x] Handles 2FA again if prompted
- [x] Graceful degradation: Doesn't fail silently if session invalid

### 5. Automated Ride Booking ‚úÖ
- [x] Uber has NO public API - uses browser automation
- [x] Uses Playwright in HEADLESS mode to automate m.uber.com
- [x] Loads saved session ‚Üí navigates to Uber ‚Üí fills destination ‚Üí clicks "Request UberX"
- [x] Handles potential security challenges:
  - [x] "Verify it's you" prompts
  - [x] Device verification requests
  - [x] Unusual activity warnings
- [x] Extracts driver name and ETA from confirmation page
- [x] Returns notification to user with ride details

### 6. OMI Integration Endpoints ‚úÖ
- [x] GET / (App Home URL)

  - [x] If not authenticated: Shows "Connect Uber Account" button
  - [x] Mobile-first responsive design
- [x] GET /auth (Auth URL)
  - [x] Launches Playwright in NON-headless mode for one-time login
  - [x] Opens Uber login page (https://auth.uber.com/login)
  - [x] Waits for user to complete login manually
  - [x] **DETECTS 2FA PROMPT**:
    - [x] Looks for selectors: input[type="tel"], input[placeholder*="code"], etc.
    - [x] If found, pauses and shows 2FA code input interface
    - [x] Waits for user to submit code via /submit-2fa-code endpoint
  - [x] Checks "Remember this device" if available
  - [x] Saves browser session to: sessions/{uid}_uber_session.json
  - [x] Redirects back to homepage
- [x] POST /submit-2fa-code (New endpoint for 2FA)
  - [x] Accepts 2FA code from user
  - [x] Resumes waiting Playwright browser
  - [x] Fills 2FA code input field
  - [x] Clicks verify/submit button
  - [x] Waits for successful authentication
  - [x] Returns: {"success": true, "message": "Authentication complete"}
- [x] GET /auth-status (Check authentication progress)
  - [x] Returns current auth state: "waiting_login", "waiting_2fa", "completed", "failed"
  - [x] Used for real-time UI updates during authentication
- [x] GET /setup-completed (Setup Completed URL)
  - [x] Checks if user has fully authenticated (including 2FA if required)
